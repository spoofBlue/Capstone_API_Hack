App Name : Urban City Discovery

The purpose of this project is to practice creating asynchronous calls to other API's.  In this project, I utilize Google Maps, Wikipedia, and Teleport (an urban city datbase with details such as cost of living, venture capital, and environmental quality) to let the user view city information on a map or text-based interface.

From the user's perspective, they are able to immediately interact with Google Maps with pre-made clickable markers.  Accessing these markers displays detailed Wikipedia and Teleport information on the city.  Zooming into Google Maps allows the user to access over 250 cities through Google Maps.  The user can also use the text-based search for any town/city through a search button located in the top left.  The user types a city with a state or country to access Wikipedia info on any city.  Many large, urban cities will have Teleport data accessible through the text-based interface as well.

Key Technologies : HTML, CSS, Javascript with the JQuery library, access to the Google Maps, Wikipedia, and Teleport APIs.
