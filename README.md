The purpose of this project is to practice creating asynchronous calls to other API's.  In this project, I utilize Google Maps, Wikipedia, and Teleport (an urban city datbase with large details) to allow the user to view information using a graphical or text-based interface.

App Name : Urban City Discovery
-A link to your live app
-Screenshot(s) of your app. This makes your app description much easier to understand.
-A summary section. This should have a concise explanation of what your app does. Try to frame this from the standpoint of what the user does, or what the app enables for the user.
-A section on the technology used. For your capstone, this is fairly simple (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery) but it's still good to list out the key technologies.
